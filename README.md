Meshroom is a powerful photogrammetry software that allows you to create 3D models from a series of photographs. Follow these detailed steps to install Meshroom, capture images, and generate a 3D model.

Step 1: Install Meshroom
Download Meshroom:

Visit the Meshroom download page: Meshroom on Softonic.
Click on the download button and save the installer to your computer.
Install Meshroom:

Locate the downloaded installer file on your computer (usually in the Downloads folder).
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
Ensure that your machine has a GPU and CUDA installed, as Meshroom leverages CUDA for faster processing.
Step 2: Capture Images
Select an Object:

Choose an object or scene you want to create a 3D model of. This could be a plant, an object, or any interesting subject.
Prepare Your Mobile Phone:

Ensure your phone's camera is clean and has sufficient battery.
Capture Images:

Take multiple photographs of the object from different angles.
Move around the object and capture images from various perspectives, ensuring you cover all sides.
Aim for at least 20-50 photos, depending on the complexity of the object.
Step 3: Import Images into Meshroom
Open Meshroom:

Launch the Meshroom application on your computer.
Create a New Project:

Start a new project by clicking on the "New" button or selecting "File" > "New".
Import Images:

Drag and drop the images you captured into the Meshroom workspace, or use the "Add Images" button to browse and select your photos.
Step 4: Process the Images
Check Images:

Ensure all your images are loaded correctly in the Meshroom workspace.
Start Reconstruction:

Click the "Start" button to begin the photogrammetry process.
Meshroom will analyze the images, match key points, and reconstruct the 3D model.
Monitor Progress:

The processing time can vary depending on the number of images and your computer's performance.
You can monitor the progress in the status bar at the bottom of the Meshroom window.
Step 5: Review and Export the 3D Model
Review the 3D Model:

Once the processing is complete, you will see the 3D model in the Meshroom viewer.
Use the navigation tools to inspect the model and ensure it meets your expectations.
Export the 3D Model:

If satisfied with the result, export the 3D model by clicking on "File" > "Export" and choosing your preferred format (e.g., OBJ, PLY).
Save Your Project:

Save your Meshroom project file for future reference or additional processing.
Additional Tips
Good Lighting: Ensure the object is well-lit from all angles to capture clear and detailed images.
Stable Shots: Keep your hand steady while taking photos to avoid blurry images.
Overlap: Ensure there's sufficient overlap between consecutive images for better reconstruction.
By following these steps, you can create detailed and accurate 3D models using Meshroom and a series of photographs taken with your mobile phone. Happy modeling!
